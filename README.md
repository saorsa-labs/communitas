- Signed and notarized by Apple
- Auto-updates enabled

## Why Communitas?

Most modern collaboration tools (Slack, Discord, Google Docs) rely on a fragile assumption: **that you always have a perfect connection to a central server.** If the internet goes down, or a cable is cut, or a server outage occurs, you stop working.

**Communitas is different.** It flips the model:

1.  **Internet-Optional**: It prioritizes **local-first** connectivity. If the global internet fails, Communitas automatically switches to your local LAN, mesh network, or direct device-to-device links. Teams in the same building can keep chatting and editing documents even if the outside world is cut off.
2.  **Post-Quantum Security**: We don't just use standard encryption. We use **NIST-standard Post-Quantum Cryptography** (ML-DSA, ML-KEM) to protect your identity and data against future threats that could break today's encryption.
3.  **True Peer-to-Peer**: There are no central servers to hack, subpoena, or crash. **You are the server.** Your data lives on your device and syncs directly with your peers.
4.  **Conflict-Free**: Using advanced **CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)**, you can edit documents offline or on a split network, and they will mathematically merge perfectly when you reconnect—no "merge conflicts" or lost work.

## Network Resilience Architecture

Communitas implements a hierarchical resilience model spanning process-local to global internet connectivity, with automatic degradation and recovery:

- **Partition Tolerance**: Groups may fragment into isolated subnetworks and automatically reconverge when connectivity restores
- **CRDT Synchronization**: Conflict-free replicated data types ensure eventual consistency across network partitions without coordination
- **Post-Quantum Security**: ML-DSA-87/ML-DSA-65 signatures and ML-KEM-768 key exchange provide quantum-resistant cryptographic verification
- **Multi-Transport Discovery**: Operates across loopback, LAN broadcast, NAT-traversed WAN, and direct public IP without central coordination
- **Catastrophic Failure Recovery**: System continues operation in local-only mode during global infrastructure failures, automatically resuming WAN operations upon restoration

Technical implementation verified through comprehensive integration testing (watchdog monitoring, exponential backoff retry, and resource limit enforcement). See [Offline Handling](docs/architecture/offline-handling.md) and [Networking](docs/architecture/networking.md) for formal specifications.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**All Platforms:**
- Rust 1.85+
- `dx` CLI 0.7.3 (`scripts/install_dx.sh` installs the pinned release)
- Node.js 18+ (Tailwind/Vite asset bundling)

**Windows Additional Requirements:**
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (C++ workload)
- Edge WebView2 runtime (Tauri uses system WebView; installer enforces `minimumWebview2Version`)
- See [Windows Build Guide](docs/development/windows-build.md) for detailed setup

**Linux:**
- GTK3/WebKitGTK runtime (Tauri WebView dependency)
- Build essentials, CMake, and platform libraries
- Refer to [docs/development/prerequisites.md](docs/development/prerequisites.md) for current dependency matrix

### Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saorsalabs/communitas.git
cd communitas

scripts/install_dx.sh       # installs dx 0.7.3

# Dioxus app development
cd communitas-dioxus
dx serve --platform desktop --hotpatch
```

### Testing
```bash
# UI smoke + lint
cd communitas-dioxus
dx check --platform desktop

# Rust linting (strict policy)
cargo clippy --all-features -- -D clippy::panic -D clippy::unwrap_used -D clippy::expect_used

# Rust unit tests
cargo test
```

To simulate authentication failures during QA, set `COMMUNITAS_UI_FORCE_AUTH_ERROR=1` before running the UI (`COMMUNITAS_UI_FORCE_AUTH_ERROR=1 dx serve --platform desktop`). This flag exercises the error-handling paths wired into `communitas-ui-service`.

## Deployment Options

Communitas supports multiple deployment scenarios for different use cases:

### Dioxus Application (End Users — Cross-Platform)
Full-featured cross-platform application (desktop GA, experimental Android/iOS runners).
```bash
cd communitas-dioxus
dx bundle --platform desktop
# optional mobile targets (stability varies)
dx bundle --platform android
dx bundle --platform ios
```
See [communitas-dioxus/](communitas-dioxus/) for details.

### Swift Application (Native macOS)
Native macOS SwiftUI app targeting macOS 14+. Connects to x0xd for all networking.
```bash
# Open in Xcode
open communitas-apple/Package.swift

# Build from command line
swift build --package-path communitas-apple
```
Both apps discover the running x0xd daemon from `~/Library/Application Support/x0x/api.port` and `api-token`.

---

## Network & Identity

Identity is the public key (pubkey_hex). Four-word networking is used only to encode
connection endpoints (IP:port) for sharing between peers.

### x0x Daemon Integration
Both the Dioxus and Swift apps talk to a local x0xd daemon for all networking. The daemon writes two files at startup:

- `~/Library/Application Support/x0x/api.port` — the `host:port` the API listens on (e.g. `127.0.0.1:12700`)
- `~/Library/Application Support/x0x/api-token` — a 64-character hex Bearer token required for authenticated endpoints

Both apps discover these at runtime via `communitas-x0x-client` (Rust) or `X0xClient` (Swift). If x0xd is not installed or not running, the onboarding gate will prompt the user to install/start it.

### Connection Words Example
```rust
// Share a connection address with a friend (IP:port encoded as words)
let connection_words = get_my_connection_words().await?;
// → "ocean-blue-eagle-star"

// Friend uses the connection words to dial directly
connect_to_peer(&connection_words).await?;
```

### Network Participation
- **Desktop Nodes**: Full participants with the Dioxus/Tauri UI (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- **macOS Nodes**: Native SwiftUI app backed by x0xd
- **Mobile Nodes**: Experimental Dioxus builds on Android/iOS (stability pending upstream Tauri updates)
